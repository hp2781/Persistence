# Persistence
Housing Returns Persistence
This project is to test the persistence in the Australian House Price Returns at SA3 level.

## Abstract
This project is to test for persistence in the Australian House Price Returns at the Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3). We use the variance ratio tests such as the bootstrap Automatic variance ratio to test if the house prices follow a random walk. If not then the returns have persistence. We also use a non parametric runs test that does not rely on any distributions or the linearity assumptions of the model. We find that there is evidence of strong persistence in House Price returns in Australia.
